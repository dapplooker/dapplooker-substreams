# Substream

Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology, developed for **The Graph** Network.

# Substream features:-

- Substreams enables developers to write Rust modules
- It provides extremely high-performance indexing by virtue of parallelization, in a streaming-first fashion.
- Low-cost caching and archiving of blockchain data, high throughput processing, and cursor-based reorgs handling.
- The ability to store and process blockchain data using advanced parallelization techniques, making the processed data available for various types of data stores or real-time systems.
